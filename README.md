# ShinyApp
This Shiny app provides a visual analysis of traffic accidents. The app displays a proportional bar plot showing accident proportions by month, categorized by selected variables such as weather, light conditions, rural/urban setting, work zone presence, and school bus involvement. Users can filter by state and select a specific accident attribute for proportional comparison.
